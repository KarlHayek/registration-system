## University Student Information System

A CLI Student Information System written in C++, where students, instructors, and admnistrators can log in and perfom their respective actions (register/unregister for a course (students), view remaining courses needed to graduate , create a course (instructors), end the semester and make students graduate (administrators) etc.) 

This was my project for the data structures course I took at university, for which it received full marks.
